# Product Registration - Fullstack Project

This project marks a significant milestone in my journey as a developer, being the **first full-stack application I have built entirely on my own**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The objective of this project was to create a product registration system, integrating a Java-based backend with an Angular frontend. It served as a practical playground to understand software organization, data flow, and the intricacies of connecting a client application to a server.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

Throughout the development process, I acquired and refined several skills:

*   **Software Organization**: Learned how to structure a full-stack project for better maintainability.
*   **Routing**: Implemented navigation within the application.
*   **Service & JPA Patterns**: Applied service-oriented architecture and JPA concepts to manage data efficiently.
*   **Backend-Frontend Integration**: Successfully connected the Angular frontend to the backend API.
*   **Database Management**: Utilized **H2 Console** for database operations.
*   **HTTP Methods**: Implemented full CRUD capabilities using `PUT`, `DELETE`, `POST`, and `GET` methods.

## 🎨 Frontend Focus: Repository & Service Structure

I placed a special emphasis on the Frontend architecture to ensure clean code and separation of concerns. I implemented a robust **Repository and Service** structure.

*   **Services**: I created dedicated services (e.g., `CategoryService`, `ProductService`) to handle business logic and HTTP communication.
*   **Repository Pattern**: I structured the data access layer to abstract the data source from the components, making the application more modular and easier to test.

This approach allowed me to keep my components, such as the product table, focused purely on presentation and user interaction while the services handled the heavy lifting of data manipulation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **Frontend**: Angular
*   **Backend**: Java (Spring Boot)
*   **Database**: H2 Database
